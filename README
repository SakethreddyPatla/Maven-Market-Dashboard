Maven Market: Data-Driven Performance Overview
This dashboard serves as the central "source of truth" for Maven Market, transforming over 269,000 transactions into a strategic roadmap for growth. 
By moving through the full BI lifecycle, I converted raw data into a high-performance analytics solution that tracks $1.76M in total revenue and $1.05M in total profit.

The Problem: Navigating Global Complexity
Maven Market faced the challenge of managing diverse product lines across international borders without a unified view of performance. 
Before this solution, it was difficult to see that while the business maintained a healthy 0.99% overall return rate, specific products were creating operational friction.

The Solution: Key Performance Indicators
I built a star-schema model to track real-time performance, allowing for a month-over-month (MoM) view of the company’s health:
Revenue Growth: In the latest month, revenue reached $120.16K, representing a +0.57% growth over the previous month.
Transaction Volume: Transactions increased to 18.33K, a significant +5.69% jump from the prior period.
Efficiency: The model monitors a $199.56 average revenue per customer across a base of 8,842 unique customers.

Actionable Product & Customer Insights
The dashboard doesn't just show totals; it identifies the specific drivers of profit and risk:
Top Performers: Moms Roasted Chicken was identified as the most ordered product, while high-margin items like Hilltop Mint Mouthwash yielded a 61.05% profit margin.
Risk Mitigation: I isolated Shady Lake Spaghetti as the most returned product, allowing for immediate quality review.
Demographic Targeting: Analysis revealed that the "Professional" (87.87K orders) and "Skilled Manual" (72.51K orders) occupations drive the bulk of transaction volume.
Loyalty Tracking: I developed a "Top 100 Customers" view, highlighting high-value individuals like Dawn Laner, who contributed 301 orders and $1,995 in revenue.

The Bottom Line
By integrating geographic mapping across regions like the USA, Canada, and Mexico with deep-dive product metrics, 
this project proves that data-backed decision-making can move the needle. 
It provides the clarity needed to scale revenue while keeping a strict eye on profit margins and return rates
